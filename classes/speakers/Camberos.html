<h2>Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the world experiences an era of rapid change and globalization, increased competition for resources, access to Information Technology and changing demographics there is the potential to shift the balance of power. Potential adversaries are using emergent globalized technology and manufacturing infrastructure to rapidly develop sophisticated military capabilities that create more contested operational environments. The challenge is to ensure our Airmen obtain the best technology, at the right time, while affordably meeting mission needs. To face these challenges, the Air Force is committed to a strong S&amp;T program that will enable fully integrated air, space, and cyberspace forces to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. This Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) program lays the technological foundation for the current and future Air Force to assure America’s security through Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power. The cornerstone of S&amp;T’s innovative power is its exceptional resources: S&amp;T experts and our unique equipment and facilities. Through AFRL, the Air Force manages S&amp;T as an integrated program by using its special resources to invest in future capabilities and provide the warfighter near-term technical support. AFRL carefully balances the investment portfolio in basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, allocated between in-house and contracted activities. Thereby or thus producing both evolutionary and revolutionary technologies focused on Air Force service core functions and capabilities.  This seminar will touch on the US Air Force Guiding Principles for Science &amp; Technology including the highest priority needs of the Air Force across the near-, mid-, and far-term, the execution of a balanced, integrated S&amp;T Program that is responsive to the Air Force Core Missions, and advancing critical technical competencies needed to address the full range of product and support capabilities.  Opportunities for collaboration will be presented, from the perspective of academic funding needs for faculty, fellowship and scholarship opportunities for students and on-site visiting scholar programs for all.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
<p>Dr. José Camberos is recognized for exceptional and sustained contributions to the development and dissemination of multidisciplinary methods for aerospace vehicle systems integration, analysis, and design.  His research has contributed significantly to core mission of the Multidisciplinary Science &amp; Technology Center at AFRL.  He is an active member of the American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics (AIAA) as an Associate Fellow. Dr. Camberos has served as a
thesis advisor and mentor for numerous graduate students at the University of
Dayton, Air Force Institute of Technology, and Wright State University and as a
National Research Council Advisor in the Summer Faculty Program and
Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program. He holds adjunct faculty positions at AFIT,
UD, and Wright State, teaching a variety of courses including Computational
Fluid Dynamics, Hypersonics, Advanced Thermodynamics, Aerodynamics, and Vehicle
Flight Dynamics.  Recently, Dr. Camberos served as AFRL’s University Relations
Manager, leading the organization towards a more comprehensive, coordinated, and
consistent effort to recruit the best &amp; brightest scientists and engineers
across academia in the U.S. and beyond.  He currently leads a team of engineers
in developing multidisciplinary analysis &amp; design capability for high-speed
systems.</p>
