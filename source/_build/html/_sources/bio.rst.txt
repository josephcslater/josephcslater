Joseph C. Slater is a professor and the current chair, as well as the director of the MS in Aerospace Systems program, of the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at Wright State University. His research interests are
dynamics, finite element modeling, control, and model identification and validation. He has worked in the fields of UAV control, turbomachinery dynamics,
fatigue, aeroelasticity, spacecraft dynamics and control, and vibration damping.
He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Aerospace Engineering, and Ph.D. in
Mechanical Engineering from the department of `Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering`_ at the `State University of New York at
Buffalo`_. He is a Fellow of `ASME`_, Associate
Fellow of `AIAA`_, and a member `Tau Beta Pi`_,
`Sigma Gamma Tau`_, and `Phi Eta Sigma`_. He is a member of the `AIAA Structural Dynamics Technical Committee`_ and a former member of the `AIAA Gossamer Spacecraft Program Committee`_.

In my spare time I enjoy contributing to open source Python_ software:

- array_to_latex: A simple module for creating LaTeX arrays from NumPy_ arrays. |array_to_latex|
- Mousai: A harmonic balance solver.  |mousai|
- vibrationtesting: A Python_ module for signal processing, modal analysis (from data), model solution (from linear second order matrix form) and model updating. |vibrationtesting|
- vibration_toolbox: A python module for vibration education loosely based on the Matlab version from 1991. |vibration_toolbox|
