Abstract
------------

As the world experiences an era of rapid change and globalization, increased competition for resources, access to Information Technology and changing demographics there is the potential to shift the balance of power. Potential adversaries are using emergent globalized technology and manufacturing infrastructure to rapidly develop sophisticated military capabilities that create more contested operational environments. The challenge is to ensure our Airmen obtain the best technology, at the right time, while affordably meeting mission needs. To face these challenges, the Air Force is committed to a strong S&T program that will enable fully integrated air, space, and cyberspace forces to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. This Science & Technology (S&T) program lays the technological foundation for the current and future Air Force to assure America’s security through Global Vigilance, Global Reach, and Global Power. The cornerstone of S&T’s innovative power is its exceptional resources: S&T experts and our unique equipment and facilities. Through AFRL, the Air Force manages S&T as an integrated program by using its special resources to invest in future capabilities and provide the warfighter near-term technical support. AFRL carefully balances the investment portfolio in basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, allocated between in-house and contracted activities. Thereby or thus producing both evolutionary and revolutionary technologies focused on Air Force service core functions and capabilities.  This seminar will touch on the US Air Force Guiding Principles for Science & Technology including the highest priority needs of the Air Force across the near-, mid-, and far-term, the execution of a balanced, integrated S&T Program that is responsive to the Air Force Core Missions, and advancing critical technical competencies needed to address the full range of product and support capabilities.  Opportunities for collaboration will be presented, from the perspective of academic funding needs for faculty, fellowship and scholarship opportunities for students and on-site visiting scholar programs for all.
