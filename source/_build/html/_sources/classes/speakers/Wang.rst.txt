Abstract
------------

Financial aid is funding available to students attending an educational institution to
cover various costs such as tuition, fees, room and board, and books. Financial aid is
available from federal, state, institutions, and private agencies, and can be awarded in the
forms of grants, education loans, and scholarships. This thesis focuses on the optimal
allocation of scholarship for a university with the objective to increase its revenue.
For a higher institution, the composition, allocation, and optimization of scholarships is
an important part of its enrollment management and has a profound impact on its financial
health. On the one hand, tuition is a significant portion of a universityâ€™s revenue and excess
use of scholarships or financial aid could reduce the revenue; on the other hand, insufficient
use of scholarship or financial aid would reduce student enrollment and quality, and thus
undermine the revenue. The optimal allocation of scholarship to solve the dilemma is nontrivial
and has been a challenge for the enrollment office at many universities.
This research proposes a series of models and methodologies to the solution of the
optimal allocation of scholarship and the methodology can be composed of two
parts. The first part is to predict the response to scholarships from applicants with various
socioeconomic backgrounds and the second is the allocation of scholarships among these
applicants to maximize revenue.
