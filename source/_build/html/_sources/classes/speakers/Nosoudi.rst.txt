Abstract
------------

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-mediated extracellular matrix destruction is the major cause of development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Systemic treatments of MMP inhibitors have shown effectiveness in animal models but it did not translate to clinical success either due low doses used or systemic side-effects of MMP inhibitors. We propose a targeted nanoparticle based delivery of MMP inhibitor at very low doses to the AAA site. Such therapy will be an attractive option for preventing expansion of aneurysms in patients without systemic side effects.
