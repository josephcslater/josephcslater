| Nov. 13           | A uniform cylinder is on an incline with   |
|                   | slope α. It is held barely out of contact  |
|                   | with the ramp and has an initial angular   |
|                   | velocity $\omega_0$ oriented to propel the |
|                   | cylinder up the ramp. The coefficient of   |
|                   | friction for both static and dynamic       |
|                   | friction is μ. (It has mass m, radius r).  |
|                   |                                            |
|                   | a\) If it is set down on the the ramp, and |
|                   |  initially slips, how far up               |
|                   | the ramp will it move before it begins rol |
|                   | ling without slipping?                     |
|                   |                                            |
|                   | b\) Once it starts rolling without slippin |
|                   | g, how far up the ramp will it             |
|                   | move before it stops moving up and reverse |
|                   | s course.                                  |

|                   | homework points) answer with a simulink    |
|                   | simulation (2 more points), using a        |
|                   | variety of physically reasonable parameter |
