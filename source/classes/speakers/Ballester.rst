Abstract
------------

Inefficient discharge planning is a major cause of both inpatient discharge delays and upstream patient waiting. While this problem has been acknowledged in medical literature, there exist few attempts to analytically propose optimal solutions. We propose several systems engineering approaches to improve aspects of discharge planning. We apply these techniques in preemptive strategies, such as discharge disposition prediction, as well as in day-of-discharge strategies, such as unit discharge targets and care provider patient prioritization. This talk will provide an overview of the methods that have been developed thus far, the results found, and the current research directions being explored.
