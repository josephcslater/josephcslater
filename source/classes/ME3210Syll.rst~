Objectives
----------

*System Dynamics* introduces students to the system level modeling of
dynamic engineering systems including, but not restricted to, linear and
rotational mechanical, fluid, thermal, and electrical systems. Modeling
of control devices (e.g. motors, heaters and pumps) is addressed.

The course focuses on a) the development of governing equations, and b)
the solution of governing equations. Development of governing equations
is by methods appropriate to each subfield. The unifying system level
analysis will be taught a) via time domain solutions, b) frequency
(Laplace domain) solutions, and c) numerical simulation in Simulink (a
modern system simulation tool).

Office Hours
------------

Tentative: Will change depending on student schedules. Tentatively
1:30-2:30 PM, Monday and Wednesday, and by appointment. Please use email
to contact me when you have questions, and to set up appointments. I
check my email throughout the day. You will get a quicker response by
email than by any other mode of communication.

Grade composition
-----------------

+--------------------+-------+
| Professionalism:   | 5%    |
+--------------------+-------+
| Homework:          | 10%   |
+--------------------+-------+
| Exams:             | 85%   |
+--------------------+-------+

Homework
--------

Homework problems will be assigned on the course web page. Homework is
tentative until Thursday at 5 PM. Homework problem solutions are
collected at the beginning of the last lecture each week. You will be
given no less than one week to do them. If there is a test scheduled on
a day homework is due, the homework will be collected the following
lecture. Each homework problem is worth 1 point unless otherwise noted.
More difficult problems may be weighted accordingly. Your final homework
score is your average total score divided by the total number of
possible points. Homework grades will be curved such that the class
average will be no lower than 85%. You are encouraged to work together
in small groups, but keep in mind that homework is assigned in order to
help you learn and keep up with the course material. Please see me if
you need help with the homework. This class is a cooperative effort
between you and me. You are also encouraged to do additional problems
out of the text for practice on your own. Use of the solution manual,
should you obtain it, is considered cheating.

Exams
-----

There will be two tests and a final exam graded on a straight, scale
(:math:`\geq 90 = A`,\ :math:`\geq 80 = B`, :math:`\geq 70 = C`,
:math:`\geq 60 = D`, :math:`< 59 = F`). The final exam will count for
two test grades. The lowest exam grade of the four will be dropped. An
8.5 in. by 11 in. formula sheet may be used provided there are no
derivations, definitions or solved problems on the sheet. It must be
turned in with the exam. Tests will be graded and returned as soon as
possible. Solutions will be discussed during the lecture following the
exam if time permits. All grading discrepancies must be brought up in
writing no later than one week after the exam is returned. A simple note
describing your contentions will do.

Professionalism
---------------

Professionalism is a measure of your behavior regarding expected
practice as a professional. This includes aspects such as attendance,
note taking, consistency of performance, tenacity in problem solution,
leadership, legibility and organization of problem solutions, clarity of
communication, seeking assistance as prudent, etc. For details on
expected behavior, please consult *The Unwritten Rules of Engineering*
by W.J. King, with revision by J.G. Skakoon. This book is available at
the library. However, for your own professional development, I highly
recommend that you `own a personal
copy <http://members.asme.org/catalog/ItemView.cfm?ItemNumber=801624>`__.
If you read an older edition of the book (prior to Skakoon), please be
attentive to the fact that some of the comments, especially those
regarding polishing shoes, are considered rather quaint today. Two
points will be automatically be deducted from your professionalism score
each time you receive less than a 70% on an exam *and* do not see me
personally within one week after receiving the exam grade to clear up
confusion.

Programming/Computer Usage
--------------------------

Programming will be done in Simulink in MATLAB. Please consult either
the hand-outs, the online MATLAB help, or the documentation I supply on
the course web site, and the manual in the computer lab. It is highly
recommended that you learn to use Simulink on your university UNIX
account as soon as possible. Run MATLAB by setting, your display
environment from your X-Windows terminal and typing at the UNIX prompt.
Run Simulink by typing at the MATLAB prompt. The best way to learn is to
play around with it, and look at some of the examples provided in
Simulink.

Problem Solutions
-----------------

All problem solutions, whether on homework, quizzes, or exams, should be
neat and orderly. They should begin with a brief problem statement and
figure (Elaborate drawings are not expected).
