ME 3210: System Dynamics Homework
------------------------------------------


Homework problems are listed for the third edition. Many sections have been
moved around from the second edition. You can use the second edition, but will
need problems from the third.

1: 1, 6 means chapter 1, problems 1 and 6.

|             | I recommend that you perform all          |
|             | appropriate work in Matlab to use this as |
|             | an opportunity to build your Matlab       |

|             | A uniform cylinder is on an incline with  |
|             | slope α. It is held barely out of contact |
|             | with the ramp and has an initial angular  |
|             | velocity :math:`\omega_0` oriented to     |
|             | propel the cylinder up the ramp. The      |
|             | coefficient of friction for both static   |
|             | and dynamic friction is μ. (It has mass   |
|             | m, radius r).                             |
|             |                                           |
|             | a) If it is set down on the the ramp, and |
|             | initially slips, how far up the ramp will |
|             | it move before it begins rolling without  |
|             | slipping?                                 |
|             |                                           |
|             | b) Once it starts rolling without         |
|             | slipping, how far up the ramp will it     |
|             | move before it stops moving up and        |
|             | reverses course.                          |
