<h2 id="lecture">Lecture:</h2>
<p>The course is Lecture/Lab. Lab is at your own pace, but some lectures will actually be introductions to the Vibration Lab (010 Russ). Lecture time will be shortened accordingly to accommodate the extra time spent in the lab.</p>
<p>It will be relatively fast-paced (I hear). You are expected to meet one-on-one with the instructor throughout the semester as much of the class is run as an individually scheduled lab.</p>
<h2 id="lab">Lab:</h2>
<p>open hours. <a href="http://www.cecs.wright.edu/rc/russtour.php3?room=secondmap">010 Russ</a>. After that, you will use the lab equipment at times of your convenience in order to complete assignments but their due dates. You are expected to be proactive in asking for equipment, as well as read manuals as necessary to enhance your skills.</p>

<h1 id="homework-30">Homework (30%)</h1>
<p>Homework problems will be assigned at the end of lectures. <em>Any statement in the book such as “it can be shown”, “left as a homework problem”… is to be treated as a homework assignment when the material is covered in class. All problems at the end of the chapter should be done as well.</em> Homework problem solutions are collected every Thursday. You will be given no less than one week to do them. If there is a test scheduled on a day homework is due, the homework will be collected the following Wednesday. Each homework problem’s worth will be scaled by difficulty, based on the number of students who complete the problem. Standard scale is 1 point. If only one person solves the problem, the problem will be scaled to 5 points.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to generate their own homework problems, turning the problem in to the instructor, along with the solution. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These will also be assigned to the class. One additional bonus point will be assigned provided the solution is also provided. Students may submit up to five problems per week, provided that they are unique from others submitted (just changing the numbers does not make the problem unique). <em>Students maynot</em>* copy problems out of another text* for the bonus points, but may propose them as a challenge to the class provided that they announce the source of the problem. <em>The instructor reserves the right to assign or not assign any particular problem based on its merits relative to the course material</em>.</p>
<p>Your final homework score is your average total score divided by the total number of possible points. You are encouraged to work together in small groups, but keep in mind that homework is assigned in order to help you learn and keep up with the course material. Also note that you are strongly rewarded for distinguishing yourself. Please see me if you need help with the homework. This class is a cooperative effort between you and me. Homework scores will be curved to a nominal 3.5 average or better.</p>
<h1 id="exams-40">Exams (40%)</h1>
<p>There will be one midterm and a final exam graded on a curve, with the average nominally being 3.5 on a 4 point scale. Minimum scale is <span class="math"> ≥ 90 = <em>A</em>,  ≥ 80 = <em>B</em>,  ≥ 70 = <em>C</em>,  ≥ 60 = <em>D</em>,  &lt; 59 = <em>F</em></span>. The final exam will count for two test grades. The lowest exam grade of the three will be dropped. An 8.5 in. by 11 in. formula sheet may be used provided there are no derivations, definitions or solved problems on the sheet. Tests will be graded and returned as soon as possible. Solutions will be discussed during the lecture following the exam if time permits. All grading discrepancies must be brought up in writing no later than one week after the exam is returned. A simple note describing your contentions will do.</p>
<h1 id="labs-30">Labs (30%)</h1>
<p>Labs involve additional research outside of the classroom, as well as some programming for data analysis. Students should consult the books on reserve at the library in addition to their own texts. In addition, it is expected that students will need to consult me before, during, and after performance of the labs.</p>
<p>Students will work in pairs on the standard labs.</p>
<p>Alternate labs may be proposed by students. Students who have specific research needs should take advantage of this opportunity to tune their learning to their specific needs. Examples are identification of noise floor, PDFs, and sources in lab experiments, identification of sensor capabilities, etc. Depending on the depth of the proposed experiment, it may be substituted for more than one below.</p>
<p>At least five of the following labs must be performed and documented to an adequate level to receive a <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> grade. Students must perform lab 1, at least one of lab [lab2], [lab3] or [lab4], plus two rotor-dynamics labs. Labs are open-ended learning experiences. Grading will reflect documented understanding gained in the lab. All data generated in the labs must be a) plotted and described in the report, b) turned in to me in .mat or ASCII format (preferred) format. Report must be hard-copy. The report with the raw data must be zipped, tar-zipped, stuffed, or what ever compression format you choose, into a single archive and emailed to me. Lab grades will be curved to an nominal average of 90% or better.</p>
