Objectives
----------

*System Dynamics* introduces students to the system level modeling of
dynamic engineering systems including, but not restricted to, linear and
rotational mechanical, fluid, thermal, and electrical systems. Modeling
of control devices (e.g. motors, heaters and pumps) is addressed.

The course focuses on a) the development of governing equations, and b)
the solution of governing equations. Development of governing equations
is by methods appropriate to each subfield. The unifying system level
analysis will be taught a) via time domain solutions, b) frequency
(Laplace domain) solutions, and c) numerical simulation in `Simulink`_ (a
modern system simulation tool).

At the end of the class, students will be able to:

1.	Identify models from data
2.	Model of rigid-body mechanical systems
3.	Solve dynamic equations
4.	Model Spring-mass damper systems
5.	Generate and simulate Block diagram models and perform simulations in `Simulink`_
6.	Model Electro-mechanical systems
7.	Model Fluid thermal systems
8.	Perform System analysis in time domain
9.	Perform System analysis in the frequency domain

Office Hours
------------

Tentative: Will change depending on student schedules. Tentatively
4:00-5:00 PM, Tuesday and Thursday, and by appointment. Please use `email <mailto:joseph.slater@wright.edu>`_
to contact me when you have questions, and to set up appointments. I
check my email throughout the day. You will get a quicker response by
email than by any other mode of communication.

**Office hours have been set to Monday 3-4 and Thursday 10:30-11:30.**

Prerequisites
-------------

EE 2010, ME 2210, ME 3120, MTH 2350, ME 3350

Course Contents
---------------

#. Introduction to Modeling and Analysis, (Chapter 1)

#. Modeling of Rigid Body Dynamics, (review of Dynamics, Chapter 3)

   -  If you cannot draw a free body diagram well, your grade and
      performance will suffer greatly. Addressing this early and
      aggressively will almost ensure success in the course. **This is a major source of lost points in this class.**

#. Dynamic Response and the Laplace Transform Method (Chapter 2 &
   Chapter 8)

#. Spring-Damper Elements in Mechanical Systems (Chapter 4)

#. Block Diagrams, State-Variable Models & Simulations (Chapter 5)

#. Electric and Electro-mechanical systems (Chapter 6)

#. Fluid/Thermal Systems (Chapter 7)

#. System Analysis in the Time Domain (Chapter 8)

#. System Analysis in the Frequency Domain (Chapter 9)

Homework
--------

Homework problems will be assigned on the course web page. Homework is
tentative until Friday at 6 PM. Homework problem solutions are
collected at the beginning of the last lecture each week. Each homework problem is worth 1 point unless otherwise noted.
More difficult problems may be weighted accordingly. You are encouraged to work together
in small groups, but keep in mind that homework is assigned in order to
help you learn and keep up with the course material. Please see me if
you need help with the homework. This class is a cooperative effort
between you and me. You are also encouraged to do additional problems
out of the text for practice on your own. Use of the solution manual,
should you obtain it, is considered cheating.

Exams and Quizzes
-------------------

There will be seven quizzes and final exam graded on a straight, scale
(:math:`\geq 90 = A`,\ :math:`\geq 80 = B`, :math:`\geq 70 = C`,
:math:`\geq 60 = D`, :math:`< 59 = F`). The final exam will count
equal-weight to four quiz grades. The lowest exam grade of the four
will be dropped. An 8.5 in.~by 11 in.~formula sheet may be used provided there are no
derivations, definitions or solved problems on the sheet. It must be
turned in with the exam. Tests will be graded and returned as soon as
possible. Solutions will be discussed during the lecture following the
exam if time permits. All grading discrepancies must be brought up in
writing no later than one week after the exam is returned. A simple note
describing your contentions will do.

A personal laptop will be required for some of the quizzes and the final exam.


Professionalism
---------------

Professionalism is a measure of your behavior regarding expected
practice as a professional. This includes aspects such as attendance,
note taking, consistency of performance, tenacity in problem solution,
leadership, legibility and organization of problem solutions, clarity of
communication, seeking assistance as prudent, etc. For details on
expected behavior, please consult *The Unwritten Rules of Engineering*
by W.J. King, with revision by J.G. Skakoon. This book is available at
the library. However, for your own professional development, I highly
recommend that you `own a personal
copy <http://members.asme.org/catalog/ItemView.cfm?ItemNumber=801624>`__.

You will be presumed to be acting professional unless I have evidence
otherwise.

One point will be automatically be lost from your professionalism score
each time you receive less than a 70% on an quiz *and* do not see me
personally within one week after receiving the exam grade to clear up
confusion. (If your grade is higher, you will receive the point automatically)

Attendance is required. One point will be lost each time I take attendance and you are not
there. I will spot check attendance as much as I feel necessary.

**Students who received all professionalism points in the past have
done far better than the rest of the class.**


Programming/Computer Usage
--------------------------

Programming will be done in `Simulink`_ (in `MATLAB`_) and in
`MATLAB`_. Please consult `MATLAB`_ help and `Google`_. It is highly
recommended that you learn to use `Simulink`_ as soon as
possible. `MATLAB`_ and `Simulink`_ are free installations for WSU
students via the `MATLAB Student Licensing`_ page.
Run `Simulink`_ by typing ``simulink`` at the `MATLAB`_ prompt. The best way to learn it is to
play around with it, and look at some of the examples provided in
`Simulink`_.

Problem Solutions
-----------------

All problem solutions, whether on homework, quizzes, or exams, should be
neat and orderly. They should begin with a brief problem statement and
figure. Elaborate drawings are not expected, but neat drawings
including pertinent information are.
