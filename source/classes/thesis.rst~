Theses/Dissertations using LaTeX
--------------------------------

LaTeX is hands down the best tool to use when writing your thesis or
dissertation. Instead of arguing the point, let me make a simple
statement. Users of LaTeX know how to use MS Word, but use LaTeX
instead. Users or MS Word don't know how to use LaTeX. It's that simple.
If your adviser won't let you use LaTeX, my condolences. Your document
will lack the polish of a professional typesetting system (Do you think
journals typeset using MS Word?), and you will be tortured by cross
reference and citation issues and inconsistencies. You likely use Word
because that's all you've ever known. Hopefully you'll stopped crawling
(using MS Word) and now walk upright (use LaTeX). If you don't, c'est la
vie. Your loss. If you want to know a little about why to use LaTeX,
consult some of the references below.

Regardless of whether you use LaTeX, it's important that you know how
to properly archive your data. If you don't store your data in a
readable format, you might as well delete it after you defend. You've
made it useless. If you want to save is for potential future use, read
my document on `archiving your data <archivingdata.pdf>`__. It's not a
great document, but it's the best I've got.

Plotting (even if you're not using LaTeX)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making quality looking plots can be a challenge. Most graphics don't
have fonts and/or font sizes that match the text, or they are all fuzzy,
etc. One of the best package for generating publication quality graphs
is `gnuplot <http://www.gnuplot.info/>`__. It allows you to specify the
size of the resulting graphic (so you don't have to "squeeze it") in
your final document, the font, the font size, tic marks, etc. You can
plot functions, as well as data, plus curve fit to it while plotting. It
can be a little bit challenging at first, so a good place to start is
with a tutorial such at `the one at Harvey Mudd
College <http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~vrable/gnuplot/using-gnuplot.html>`__
and `the one at Duke <http://www.duke.edu/~hpgavin/gnuplot.html>`__.
Yes, you may think you can do this as well in Excel, but the reality is
the cartoony plots in Excel look good in brochures and business
presentations, not engineering and science technical papers.

- Do not include file extensions when including files. LaTeX can choose the best you have, or switch from eps to pdf etc.

- Use vector graphics at every instance possible (anything that is not
  a photograph). At the very least, save a version in vector form for your adviser. See `archiving your data <archivingdata.pdf>`__.

WSU LaTeX Thesis/Dissertation style file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use this, and you will have a consistent document that meets WSU
guidelines. Don't add your own formatting. Use only structure commands.
`LaTeX Template for WSU Thesis <WSUThesisTemplate.zip>`__
(Created by Sean Mortara with my assistance).

Please send corrections or errors in this template to me. Some effort
has been made to meet the `WSU School of Graduate Studies
Guidelines <http://www.wright.edu/sogs/thesis/format.html>`__, and this
template may actually be good enough, however no warranted is expressed
or implied. The template is based on past theses. Please feed back any
corrections to me.

Some Basic Introductions to LaTeX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are, or will be, out of date, but are a good start in learning
LaTeX. Pick and choose as you need. Get the more updated documents from
`CTAN <http://www.ctan.org/>`__ (look for the dtx or tex file in the
appropriate package) to get the latest documents. Send me the new file
and I'll post it.

- `Gentle Introduction to TeX <gentle.pdf>`__
-  `Graphics Package <grfguide.pdf>`__
-  `Making Double Lines in Tables <hhline.pdf>`__

Windows Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My current recommendations are to use:

#. JabRef (Editing Bibliography database)
#. Either MikTeX or TeXLive (I don't have enough to make a
   recommendation)
#. TeXnicCenter (Includes built-in spell checker. See Options:Spelling.
   Select Check Spelling while typing)
   Forward and inverse search work automatically. Double click in Yap to
   go to that point in your editor. F5 in TeXnicCenter to go to that
   point in your dvi file. Windows users should use LaTeX->DVI until
   this works for PDFs. You can use LaTeX->PDF to directly make a PDF
   document (and should, because any other way makes a messy document).
   \\usepackage{times} is a good idea.
#. Ghostscript (you may want to use it to convert ps files to eps files)
#. Adobe Acrobat Reader

Go to `TeX on Windows <http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=TeX_on_Windows>`__

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`LyX <http://www.lyx.org>`__ is something like a GUI version that is
easier for a novice to work on, but can be somewhat limiting for someone
comfortable with more power available only when editing the raw LaTeX.
Dr. Klingbeil is a strong fan of it, but I find directly typing formulas
and macros using a dedicated LaTeX editor (Emacs is my favorite) to be
much faster. If LaTeX is intimidating to you, use LyX. It still provides
most of the benefits over Word (better cross referencing,
cleaner/professional looking output). However, I'm not familiar with
using my style file with it (or if it's even possible). However, Jeremy
Daily did his dissertation in LyX just fine.

Checking Spelling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no excuse for not checking spelling in your latex document.
Note that you cannot blindly believe whatever the spell checker says.
Words such as "there" and "their" can be spelled correctly but be the
wrong choice.

#. Mac users: Use
   `CocoAspell <http://ict.usc.edu/~leuski/cocoaspell/>`__
#. Windows users: Use `aspell for Windows <http://aspell.net/win32/>`__
#. Linux users: install aspell and use it. It should be available as a
   package for your distribution.

Checking Grammar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`LanguageTool <http://www.languagetool.org>`__ (follow instructions to
install and run) can be used on any platform with Java 5.0 or later
installed. Be aware that it provides suggestions. Just like spelling, it
is helpful in finding potential errors, not actual errors, and will
often provide bad suggestions, just like MSWord.

Making Presentations (in LaTeX)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are `a number of ways to make presentations <http://www.miwie.org/presentations/presentations.html>`__
out of your thesis easily. All the useful parts of PowerPoint without
the garbage. In most cases you make PDF files from your latex document.
Buttons, and incremental displays, and... can be set up.

Here is a `Wright State University Beamer <BeamerThemeWrightState.zip>`__ package I generated from
another source. You can make pretty slick looking PDF presentations from
it.
