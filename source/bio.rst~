Dr. Joseph C. Slater is Professor of Mechanical and Materials
Engineering and Director of the MS in Aerospace Systems Program. He received
his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Aerospace Engineering, and Ph.D. in
Mechanical Engineering from the department of `Mechanical and
Aerospace Engineering`_ at the `State University of New York at Buffalo`_ under
the guidance of `Dr. Daniel J. Inman`_. Dr. Slater joined the
`Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering`_ at Wright State
University in the Fall of 1993. His research interests are mode
localization (pertaining to high cycle fatigue), nonlinear dynamics,
nonlinear system ID, turbomachinery dynamics, smart structures,
viscoelastic damping, and gossamer structures. He is an Associate
Fellow of `AIAA`_, and a member of `ASME`_, `SEM`_, `Tau Beta Pi`_,
`Sigma Gamma Tau`_, and `Phi Eta Sigma`_. He is a member of the `AIAA Gossamer
Spacecraft Program Committee`_ and the `AIAA Structural Dynamics
Technical Committee`_.
