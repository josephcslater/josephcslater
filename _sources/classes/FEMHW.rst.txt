------------------

Homework assignments are listed by assignment week and due date.
Assignments may change up to 1 week before the due date.
**Do not print this out!**

Week 1 (Sept. 2- 9/2):

- 1.3: 1, 2, 3, 4
- 1.4: 1, 2, 5
- What do "exact" nodal values really mean?
- What complaint do senior engineers have about modern novice
  engineers using FEA?
- FEA gained respectability in academia when it was recognized as a special case of what method?

- Programming task: Learn Matlab well enough to perform the
  following. You need not turn it in. (if you can't do this, see
  me)
  Write a function file (no prompts) that returns a list (vector/array) of prime
  numbers. Inputs to the function are: low bound in returned numbers,
  high bound on returned numbers, and a list of numbers that should be
  excluded if they happen to be prime numbers.

- Programming task: For the preceding result, plot the cumulative
  value (y axis) versus the returned vector.

Week 2 (due 9/9):

- Rotate the mass matrix of the planar beam/rod element by :math:`45^\circ`.

- Determine the 3D (unrotated) beam+beam+rod+torsion rod stiffness and mass matrix.

- Find the rigid body modes of a standard Euler-Bernoulli beam element. They are the eigenvectors corresponding to the zero eigenvalues. Sketch all coordinates (rotation and displacement of nodes, and the connecting deflection between the nodes) and explain them.
- 2.2: 3
- 2.3: 4, 6
- 2.4: 1, 2

Week 3 (due 9/16):


Week 4 (due 9/23): 


Week 5 (due 9/30):
- 2.4: 2, but using rotation matrices
- 2.5: 2, 3
- 2.6: 3, 4
- 2.8: 3
- All of chapter 2 should be read and understood by now.
- Run 4 cases(examples) using the beam3example element and compare to closed-form solutions to partially validate the element/code.
- Rotate the mass matrix of the rod-beam element :math:`45^\circ`. Presume a length of 1.
