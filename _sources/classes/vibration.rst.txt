- `ME460/660 Course Syllabus`_
- `ME460/660 Course Syllabus (PDF format)`_
- `Department Version (more detail) (PDF format)`_
- `Formula Sheet for Exams`_: This sheet may be brought to the exam. It must be turned in with exams. No other formula sheets are allowed.

HW and Other Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Homework`_: These will change throughout the quarter. Homework may
  be a) postponed, b) added, but never c) deleted. So, working ahead
  will not hurt you. If the time stamp on the page is after class, OR I
  state in class that the homework on the website is final for the week,
  then assignment posted is the finalized assignment.
