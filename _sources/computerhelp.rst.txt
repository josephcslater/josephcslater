Software
~~~~~~~~~~

There are a ton of tools out there to help with math calculations. I prefer to use free software because:
- It is always available to me, regardless of location, employment, which project I'm working on, or whether I can connect to a license server.
- It is more than adequate.

I don't like the idea of people graduating without skills to get things done without all of the nice tools we make available. Many students contact me and inform us that they aren't available where they work for a variety of reasons, cost being the major one.


Regardless, the university offers these for students (but you can't use it after).

Free while a student
==========================

- `Matlab`_
- `Mathematica`_


Free forever
================

- `Maxima <http://maxima.sourceforge.net/>`__: Free symbolic math package (capabilities like Mathematica). `Maxima 'cheat sheet' <http://www.hippasus.com/resources/symmath/maximasym.html>`__.

- `Octave`_

  `Octave (main web site) <http://www.octave.org>`__: Octave is a free
  alternative similar to Matlab, available on Windows, Linux, Mac, and
  others. Being open source you have assurance that it will be available
  in the future without the need for an employer to purchase Matlab or
  another proprietary system. The advantage of learning open-source
  software is robustness to any given work environment.

- `Python`_ (include `SymPy`_)

  `Python`_ is a full-featured rising programming language that is widely used, from web interfaces, database management, and scientific computation. It is the most `widely sought programming language skill <http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2016/>`__ that is useful to mechanical engineering students. If you learn one language well, I recommend this one. It's what I use every day, and it's what I use for this website.

  - I recommend install the `Anaconda`_ package or the `WinPython`_ distribution which runs off a thumb drive!

  - Learning about capabilities comes from scouring `SciPy`_

  - For learning, see `Learning Scientific Python`_

Python is what I use each and every day.

`Matlab`_
^^^^^^^^^^

Wright State students get a `free student version of Matlab`_. Search Wright State's computer support pages (CATS) to find it if the link doesn't work.

Octave (Matlab for free - kind of)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Octave (main web site) <http://www.octave.org>`__: Octave is a free
alternative similar to Matlab, available on Windows, Linux, Mac, and
others. Being open source you have assurance that it will be available
in the future without the need for an employer to purchase Matlab or
