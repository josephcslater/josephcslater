        \LARGE{ME 712 Lab 1: 3-Dimensional Frame/Truss Element Code}
        Due May 16
\end{center}
\vspace{.3in}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a finite element submodule
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a general element code to generate the elemental stiffness and mass matrices  for a single three-dimensional rod/torsion-rod/beam linearly tapered element for WFEM. 

%\item Write a code to generate the elemental  mass matrix in local coordinates.

\item Write an additional routine that returns the coordinate transformation matrix.

\item Obtain the FE matrices ($M$ and $K$) in global coordinates.

\item Write a subroutine to assemble these elements into the global matrix.
\end{enumerate}
%\item Write a subroutine to apply specified boundary conditions (imposed displacements).

%\item Write a subroutine to solve for the entire displacement vector.

\item Check your code by comparing the results of your code to that of ANSYS  for a sufficiently complex problem. Be sure to do at least one mesh convergence study in addition to the following bench marks (See 3 below).

\begin{enumerate}
\item Static simple and complex (complicated)
\item Dynamic theoretical: compare to closed-form dynamic mode shapes and natural frequencies
\item Prove that choice of coordinate does not change your answers through rotating your problem a partial angle (less than 90 degrees in all three directions.). 
\item As least one dynamic case unique to your group validated against ANSYS. 
\end{enumerate}

%\item Work in groups of . 
\item Reports should show tables comparing continuum theory/{}ANSYS/ your code results for numerous validation cases. Dynamic cases must also show convergence to continuum theory when the mesh is refined for both rod, torsion rod, and beam cases. The more validation that is performed, the higher your work will be regarded. Put code and transcripts in an appendix.

\item All reports and codes and input files must be zipped and emailed to me in a single package. 

\end{enumerate}
