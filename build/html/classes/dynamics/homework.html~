<ul>
  <li>2: 33, 34, 40, 44, 49</li>
  <li>Derive the equation of motion for a rotating unbalance system
using Lagrange's equation</li>

</ul>
Week 5 <br>
<ul>
  <li>None<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Week 6<br>
<ul>
  <li>2: 51, 53, 55, 65, 78 (use vtb), 79 (use vtb)<br>
  </li>
  <li>TB2.2, TB2.4</li>
  <li>Exam solutions (you solve each problem again)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Week 7<br>
<ul>
  <li>3: 1, 2, 6, 11, 14, 24, 27.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Week 8<br>
<ul>
  <li>In class problem: Plot the time response of a system excited by
repeated impulses. Plot the magnitudes of the coefficients (X) versus
frequency. Pick your own m, c, and k (make sure to plot the results in
the vicinity of resonance, though). c must be such that the system is
very lightly damped.</li>

  </li>
</ul>
