<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   The task of designing a one-lane bridge for immediate construction has been
assigned to your group. You are competing with other companies for the
contract, and as a result, want to generate as competitive a proposal as possible.
Only two types of beams and one type of cable are available for construction of
the bridge. The reason for this restriction is to simplify construction and
minimize the complexity that occurs when a large number of parts must be
tracked and supplied.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Your task is to design the side of the bridge (a 2-D truss) and a support for
the road bed using the available materials such that the load carrying capacity of
each of member is not exceeded and a sufficient additional degree of
safety is provided. The truss must extend over a 20 meter ravine and be
capable of supporting a 60 kN, 3.5 m wide, vehicle at any location on the
bridge.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   The thinner beam (element type 1) has a load carrying capacity of 14<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">.</span>1 kN
and can be obtained in 6 meter lengths. The maximum internal bending moment
is 40 kN-m.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   The larger beam (element type 2) has a load carrying capacity of 30<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">.</span>4
kN, can be obtained in 5 meter lengths, and has a cost of materials and
transportation of roughly twice that of the smaller beams. The maximum
internal bending moment is 160 kN-m.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   The cable has a load carrying capacity of 27<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">.</span>4 kN, can be obtained in 60

meter lengths, and is comparable in cost to the smaller beams for a 7 m
section.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   You may assume that 1<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">.</span>5 m <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7;</span>1<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">.</span>5 m square rigid plate are available and
capable of supporting 20 kN anyplace on their surface. The cost of the plates is
roughly 1<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x2215;</span>4 that of the thinner beam.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Consider safety, ease of assembly, cost, and possible variation in material
quality in your design. Take three full <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">typewritten </span>pages (double spaced) to
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your design with respect to the
aforementioned considerations. This is in addition to mechanical sketches and
analysis. The maximum load in each member of the truss must be displayed in a
clearly labeled figure. All of the design sketches you make and their analyses
should be in the appendix. In addition, the report should clearly indicate what
parts of the project were performed by each member of the group. Additionally,
each member of the group is required to turn in a confidential evaluation of
each of the other members of the group to me at the completion of the
project.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Which member in your design do you expect to fail first if the bridge is
overloaded? What is your safety factor?
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   The safety factor of the bridge is the smallest ratio of the load capability of a
member divided by the greatest load it will sustain. Anything below 1 is a
non-working bridge.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   Be sure to analyze the bridge for appropriate loading at any location on the
bridge so that the determined maximum expected loads in each member are
appropriate.
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Proposal Format</h3>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >The report must contain the following items:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Title page: Design title, proposal authors
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Overview
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Design  details:  bridge  specifications,  size,  cost,  safety  factors  of
     members, drawings of bridge, strengths and weaknesses of your design
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Present the loads, load capabilities, and safety factor for each member

     in table form.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Conclusion: Brief summary of design.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Appendix: Details of analysis describing method of analysis. At least
     three working design iterations, showing analysis of each truss. They
     do not have to be different types of bridge, they must simply have
     different node locations.</li></ul>
