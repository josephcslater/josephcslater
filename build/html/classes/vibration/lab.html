<H2>Lab 1: Computation of the Free Response</H2>

<p>
Three single degree of freedom systems are subjected to free vibration. 
The mass for each system is m = 441 kg, the spring stiffness for each
system is k = 19881 N/m, and the damping coefficients are c = 876.5
N-s/m, 5922 N-s/m, and 10673 N-s/m.  Write a computer program in
M<font size="-1">ATLAB</font> to determine whether each system is underdamped,
critically damped, or overdamped.  Solve the equation of motion for
each case (use the equations in the book and substitute the initial
conditions) and plot the solutions.  The initial conditions are
x(0) = 0.01 m, and v(0) = 0 m/s.  Plot 10 seconds of the solution
using 300 data points.  By measuring the period and log decrement off
the plot (use the <font face="helvetica">zoom</font> command after plotting the data), estimate
the stiffness and damping coefficients assuming m = 441 kg.  To how
many decimal places is it reasonable to estimate the damping
coefficient in this case?  To how many places is it reasonable to
estimate the stiffness?  <em>Hint: in order to make this judgement,
print out the un-zoomed plots and estimate the value from what you can
measure on the page.  It is the relative measurement accuracy, not
absolute, that we are looking for.</em>

<p>
<em>Design Part</em>: Design (choose c and k) for an
automobile, such that there is an additional static displacement of 1
cm for each additional 80 kg passenger entering the car, and the
response envelope decays to 5% of its original value after 2 second. 
Assume the suspension system has four equal springs and four equal
dashpots.  You may use the <i>Engineering Vibration Toolbox</i> in
performing your design.

<p>

<H2>Lab 2: Identification of Damping Using Log Decrement</H2>

<p>
  Use an impulse hammer to excite the small beam in the Vibrations Lab. Record
 the time response of the acceleration. Move the accelerometer and hammer around
 to different locations until the response looks like a pure decaying sinusoid
 (not multiple decaying sinusoids added together).  Your lab TA can
 assist you with this.

<p>
 Use log decrement (section 1.6 in the text) to determine the amount of
 viscous damping in the beam (find <font face=symbol>z</font
>).  Use the multiple cycle
 formula (see problem 1.41) over various sections of the decaying
 sinusoid (higher, middle, and lower amplitudes as well as over the
 entire amplitude range).  Do you get the same damping ratio over each
 range?  If not, why?

<p>
 Determine the natural frequency by measuring the period of one cycle. 
 Consider various sections of the decaying sinusoid (higher, middle,
 lower amplitudes as well as over the entire amplitude range).  Is the
 natural frequency consistent?  If not, why.

<p>
 Consider the force signal. The total impulse imparted onto the system is found
 by integrating the impulse over time. Observe now your acceleration signal.
 Use the initial amplitude of the acceleration (the amplitude for the
 first few cycles) to estimate the initial amplitude of the velocity
 after the hammer strike.  Note that this is is acceptable to presume
 that over only a few cycles that the amplitude of the acceleration is
 <font face=symbol>w</font
><sup>2</sup>A while the amplitude of the velocity is <font face=symbol>w</font
>A since
 the damping is very light. Recall from dynamics that the impulse on a
 body is equal to its change in momentum (<font face=symbol>D</font
>mv ) from
 the principle of impulse and momentum.  Use this to obtain an
 ``effective'' mass for the wing.  Then use the natural frequency and
 damping ratio to estimate an ``effective'' damping coefficient and
 stiffness.

<p>
 Use the vibration toolbox to calculate the response of the beam (vtb1_1) by
 guessing the initial velocity. Plot the experimental results over this plot.
 Use the <font face="helvetica">hold</font> command to keep the previous plot displayed.  Then,
 adjust the time scale of the experimental response so that the
 response starts at t = 0 by using only the elements of the time vector
 and the response vector after the hit occurred.  Then plot the
 experimental results using the plot command.  e.g. Say the variable
 <font face="helvetica">t</font> has 500 elements, 400 of which are after the hit.  Redefine
 <font face="helvetica">t</font> by typing
 
<p>
 <font face="helvetica">t=t(101:500)</font>;

<p>
 This redefines the new array <font face="helvetica">t</font> to contain only the elements 101
 to 500 of the old array <font face="helvetica">t</font>. Do the same with the response variable. 
 Try to adjust <font face=symbol>w</font
> and <font face=symbol>z</font
> in <font face="helvetica">vtb1_1</font> so that they match
 your data in appearance. Remember, the data you have is acceleration
 data, while <font face="helvetica">vtb1_1</font> plots displacement.  The 
 acceleration data should be approximately -<font face=symbol>w</font
><sup>2</sup> times that of
 the <font face="helvetica">vtb1_1</font> plot.  This is valid since the system is only slightly
 damped.  Take the second time derivative of equation (1.36) and plot
 it versus -<font face=symbol>w</font
><sup>2</sup> times equation (1.36) for evidence of this:

<p>
 Explain the differences between the estimated system response and the
 measured system response.

<H2>Lab 3: Frequency Domain Identification Techniques</H2>

<p>
Use a hammer to excite the small beam in the Vibrations Lab. Find the
transfer function between two points on the beam.

<p>
Use quadrature peak picking as well as log decrement to determine the
amount of viscous damping in the beam (find <font face=symbol>z</font
>, use example
7.4.1 as a guide).  Do you get the same damping ratio as using log
decrement?  If not, why?  Is this a better way to measure damping? 
Why?

<p>
Determine the first natural frequency from the transfer function. Do you get the
same results as counting cycles in the time domain? If not,why? Which method is
better?

<p>
Compare your natural frequency results to the closed form solution in table
6.4. Can you explain any difference?
Lab 3 Special Instructions, for Fall 1999:

<p>

<OL type="1">    
<li> Take the data as in Lab 2, but repeat the experiment 10 times,
    saving the data in 10 different files.  Make sure you have good hits,
    no double strikes or overloads.  Strike the wing in the same place
    each time.

<p>
    
<li> Load each data file into M<font size="-1">ATLAB</font>.  Each time you load a data
    file, append the acceleration and force vectors to the existing acceleration and force
    vectors.  That is, start by loading the first file.  Put the
    displacement in the vector <font face="helvetica">x</font> using <font face="helvetica">x=disp(:);</font> and do likewise
    using <font face="helvetica">f=force(:);</font>.  You must pull the variables <font face="helvetica">disp</font> and
    <font face="helvetica">force</font> out of the data files as instructed by your GTA. For each file
    thereafter, use the commands <font face="helvetica">x=[x disp(:)];</font> and <font face="helvetica">f=[f
    force(:)];</font>.  The result will be two matrices with 10 columns.  Use
    any one of the time vectors and you can <font face="helvetica">plot(t(:),x)</font> or
    <font face="helvetica">plot(t(:),f)</font>.  You must use the colons to put all of these
    vectors in column form.
    
<p>
    
<li> Use the command <font face="helvetica">tfest(expwin(x),expwin(f),t)</font> to plot
    the estimated frequency response function.  The function <font face="helvetica">expwin</font>
    is used to finesse the data a little bit.  You can read the help to
    see what it does.
    
<p>
    
<li> Use <font face="helvetica">vtb7_4</font> to estimate the natural frequency and damping
    ratio.  You will need to get the transfer function and frequency
    vector out of <font face="helvetica">tfest</font>.  Type <font face="helvetica">help tfest</font> to see how to do this. 
    Add these results into your comparison.  Ignore the values <font face="helvetica">a</font> and
     <font face="helvetica">com</font> returned by <font face="helvetica">vtb7_4</font>.  We will use them in later labs.

<H2>Lab 4: Suspension Design</H2>

<p>
Design the suspension system for a 1000 kg automobile (choose the 
stiffness and damping values) subject to the following constraints: 
four wheels (four identical dashpots and springs), a maximum 
additional static 
displacement of 1 cm for each 80 kg passenger entering the car, and a 
displacement transmissibility of less than 2. See Sections 2.3 and 
5.2 in the text, and take advantage of the Engineering Vibration
Toolbox.

<p>

<H2>Lab 5: Computation of Rotating Unbalance.</H2>

<p>
Use an impulse hammer to excite the cruise missile wing in the Vibrations 
Lab at the base of the motor. Find the transfer function between the 
force and acceleration at that point. Also record the time response of the acceleration.

<p>
Find the natural frequency <font face=symbol>w</font
> from the frequency response using the same procedure 
as used in lab #3.  Find the maximum acceleration of the
system from the time response of acceleration. 

<p>
Now rotate the unbalance mass. Record the time response of the acceleration after 
exciting the system at resonance by varying the speed of rotating
mass.     

<p>
Recall that transfer function is the Laplace transform of the ratio of
output response to the input forcing function. Find the maximum acceleration 
and determine the rotating unbalance in the system m<sub>0</sub> e.   

<p>
    
<H2>Lab 6: Vibration Absorber Design</H2>

<p>
Use the Engineering Vibration Toolbox, chapter 6 of your textbook, and 
the books <i>Formulas for Natural Frequency and Mode Shapes</i> by 
Blevins and the <i>Shock and Vibration Handbook</i> by Harris 
(available at the library) to design a vibration absorber to knock 
out the first natural frequency of the wing in the vibration lab.  As 
a courtesy to your fellow students, please do not sign out these books.

<p>

<H2>Lab7: Modal Analysis of a Cruise Missile Wing</H2>

<p>
Perform a complete modal analysis on the cruise missile wing in the Vibrations
Lab. Determine the first 5 modes (natural frequencies and mode shapes) of
the beam. How might this effect the way the missile is controlled (How can
the modes hurt performance)? What would happen to the natural frequencies of the
wing if it were attached to a cruise missile instead of the steel and concrete
base? Why?

<p>
  
<H2>Lab 8: Model Creation Using Modal Analysis Data</H2>
 
<p>
 Construct a physical model of the wing using the experimental data from lab
 4. Do this by selecting nodes 5,10,12,16,18 as degrees of freedom
 to keep (You must keep as many as you have mode shapes). Build the matrix
 <font face=symbol>L</font
> in Matlab. Assume the modes shapes are the columns of S, in
 order. Use equation (4.74) and (4.77) to find M and K (Hint:
 M = inv(S<font face=symbol>¢</font
>)*inv(S)). Find the mode shapes of the equations and compare to your
 experimental results. Write a script file in Matlab to perform all of these
 tasks and turn it in with your results.
 
<p>
 Questions: Does it matter which degrees of freedom you keep? What does it
 depend on? Give an example of how you would choose which degrees of freedom to
 keep in a real world problem.
