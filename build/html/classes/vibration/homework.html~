  <li>1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 15 (hint: 'help surf' in matlab), 21, 25<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Week 2<br>

<ul>
  <li>1: 27, 28, 36, 39, 47, 59, 66, 72, 74, 77</li>
</ul>
Week 3<br>

  <li>2: 3, 4<br>
  </li>
  <li>4: 30 (derive the equations of motion using Lagrange's equations)</li>
</ul>
Week 4<br>

<ul>
  <li>2: 9, 15, , 21, 26, 31, 33, 34, 40, 44, </li>
  <li>Derive the equation of motion for a rotating unbalance system using
    Lagrange's equation</li>
</ul>
Week 5 <br>

<ul>
  <li>2.49<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Week 6<br>

<ul>
  <li>2: 51, 53, 55, 65, 87 (use vtb), 88 (use vtb)<br>
  </li>
  <li>TB2.2, TB2.4</li>
</ul>
Week 7<br>

<ul>
  <li>3: 1, 2, 6, 11, 14, 24, 31, redo exam<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Week 8<br>

<ul>
  <li>In class problem: Plot the time response of a system excited by
    repeated impulses. Plot the magnitudes of the coefficients (X) versus
    frequency. Pick your own m, c, and k (make sure to plot the results in
    the vicinity of resonance, though). c must be such that the system is
    very lightly damped.</li>
  <li>3: 7, 8, 15<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 9<br>

<ul>
  <li>4: 1, 2, 3, 4 (1-4 are really one long problem), 7, 8, 15, 40, 41, 54,
    67 (you are expected to use matlab to save time, but should be able to
    handle 2 DOF systems by hand)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
