  <p>Finding me, like finding any other professor, can be a challenge. Only part of what I need to do can be done in my office, and often what does required my undivided attention. The best way to find me is to come during my office during posted office hours. They change every quarter. They are announced in class, and are available by stopping by my office or contacting the department office. I can be contacted directly via email (see below).</p>

<p>Please also see my calendar (link on left).</p>

<p>I also am sometimes available via instant messaging (certainly for office hours). I email my IM accounts to my class as the beginning of the quarter. If you need it again, just send me an email. I use almost every IM service. </p> 

<p>I check my email very regularly. If I don't respond within 24 hours during the week, I am probably out of town or your email got caught by SPAM filters (please read below). If you come looking for me, I may be in any of the following places listed in order of likelihood.

Email is a relatively low-reliability mode of communication. If I do not respond to your email message, please contact me via telephone. SPAM filters may have gotten your message. Email from within the university has a much greater likelihood of getting through the SPAM filters than email from gmail, yahoo, etc. <br>

You can use the university email system via <a href="http://mail.wright.edu">mail.wright.edu</a>.
<br>
I can receive most forms of signed/encrypted email. Use of digital signatures improves the likelihood of me receiving your email message. You can get my <a href="../key.gpg.asc">GPG Public Key</a><br> and use GPG for free. (<a href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">Windows</a>, <a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html">Mac</a>). Alternatively, <a href="http://www.thawte.com">the free-for-personal-use identification certification solution</a> also works well. (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;286159&Product=out2003">Windows</a>, <a href="http://joar.com/certificates/">Mac</a>, also search help for Outlook and Mail under "certificate". )
 


<!-- My instant messenger accounts are listed in my vcard (which can be viewed in a text editor if you don't have a vcard reader). My account is one of the most bombarded I know. For example, in Dec 2006, I received 24,997,404 SPAM messages filtered by the university SPAM filters. 3,167,338 emails were not identified as SPAM. By my best estimate is that only 0.1-0.5% is not junk.  -->
