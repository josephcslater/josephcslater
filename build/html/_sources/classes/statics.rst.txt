ME 2120: Statics
-------------------------------

Must-read stuff (Fall 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Syllabus <ME212Syll.html>`__
-  `Syllabus (PDF format) <ME212Syll.pdf>`__
-  `Homework 1 Problems <../materials/HW1.pdf>`__. (Due 3rd day of
   class).
-  `Homework problems <homework.shtml>`__. These will change throughout
   the quarter. Homework may be a) postponed, b) added, but never c)
   deleted. So, working ahead will not hurt you. If the time stamp on
   the page is after class, OR I state in class that the homework on the
   website is fine, then assignment posted is the finalized assignment.
